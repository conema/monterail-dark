# Monterail Dark
_Monterail Dark, a Thunderbird theme inspired by the mockup of Monterail_

## What is this?
This is a full theme for the Thunderbird e-mail client, inspired by [Monterail](https://monterail.com/blog/2016/the-power-of-email-clients-why-did-we-redesign-thunderbird) mockup and by [spymastermatt](https://github.com/spymastermatt/thunderbird-monterail)'s dark theme. As opposed to the spymastermatt's version, this theme can be **installed easily and quickly with an addon** and it's **fully compatible with Thunderbird 60.x**.

## Installation
### Manual
The first step is to [download]() the theme (in .xpi extension). An extensive guide for install the xpi file can be found [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-addon-thunderbird) on the Mozilla support site, starting from "A slightly less ideal case". The Addon Manager can be found by clicking the menu icon ![menu](https://prod-cdn.sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/gallery/images/2017-10-22-15-37-15-18c775.png) (on the right, next to the search bar) followed by Add-ons and click on the Themes panel on the left.

### Theme market
The addon will be published in the thunderbird theme market as soon as possibile, to allow a simpler download and update.
